it would look diferent because of my screen size.

Changes on the website:

                                            <!-- HTML -->

On div class="content", I changed the class to div class="marketing-info"

Added a strong, to all h2 and h3 elements in the html (except the footer) to make it important.

On div class="benefits", I changed the classes that are inside the div to one class div class="benefit-info" 

Added alt to all the images with a description about what is happening in the images (except the icons from the benefits div, it didn't seemed important to add it)

I added more empty lines to make it more readable for the other coder that uses it.

Added one more id "id="search-engine-optimization"" on the div.

                                             <!-- CSS -->

There were redundant code through the CSS file, so I condence it by making classes with the same name on the HTML and then applying it to the CSS file making the other codes unusable and deleting it making the code more neat and easy to follow along.

Change the images classes names "benefit-lead", "benefit-brand", "benefit-cost" to one class named "benefit-image"

On ".header div" I deleted the font-family since it is already stated on ".header"

On ".header", ".benefits", and ".footer", I added the " '' " to 'Arial' and 'sans-serif'
